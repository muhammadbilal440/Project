        <h1>Jhang</h1>
<p>Jhang (Punjabi / Urdu: جھنگ; Punjabi pronunciation: [ˈd͡ʒ(ʱ)ə̂ŋ.gᵊ]; Urdu pronunciation: [d͡ʒʱəŋɡ]) is the capital city of Jhang District, located in central Punjab, Pakistan. Positioned on the east bank of the Chenab River, it is the 13th most populous city in Pakistan. Jhang spans a diverse landscape, combining fertile agricultural lands, historical landmarks, and cultural richness. The district covers an area of approximately 10,520 square kilometres (about 4,060 square miles), making it a moderately large region in Punjab.

    A defining natural feature of the district is the Thal Desert, known for its sweeping sand dunes and challenging agricultural conditions due to deep underground water levels. Despite this, Jhang thrives as an agricultural hub, with its fertile lands providing sustenance and economic stability for its people.
    
    The city boasts a rich historical and cultural heritage. One of its significant archaeological sites, Shorkot Bhir, spans 20 kilometres, featuring ancient fortified walls that date back thousands of years. Jhang is also known for its spiritual significance, hosting revered Sufi shrines, including the Tomb of Hazrat Sultan Bahu, which attracts thousands of visitors annually for religious and cultural events.
    
    Beyond its historical and religious landmarks, Jhang reflects a blend of tradition and progress. Its vibrant marketplaces, rural charm, and connection to the Chenab River make it a unique part of Pakistan's cultural and geographical tapestry.</p>
